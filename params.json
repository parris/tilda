{"name":"Tilda","body":"What works:\r\n- Text Export, with some alignment features\r\n- All other shapes export as images \r\n- Opacity based animations work, but only in \"after previous\" mode and all are simplified to a simple linear transition   \r\n- Z-ordering  \r\n- Presentation export  \r\n- Single Level Bulleting (bullet char not preserved yet)  \r\n\r\nWhat needs work:\r\n- https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/536345/stories \r\n\r\nIssues:\r\n- http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=125608\r\n   - In chrome, resizing is a little funky for some reason. This does not occur in firefox or IE. I believe their implementation of svg is having some issues.\r\n\r\nTilda\r\n=====\r\n\r\nA powerpoint to SVG/VML/JS/CSS/HTML &quot;compiler&quot;. \r\nTilda has multiple components, the Powerpoint(PPT) add-in itself which allows you to grab a specific slide or all slides. RaphaelJS and the resizing script to make the slide appear \"fullbrowser\" much like how swfs are rendered fullbrowser. A test project to test all the functionality of C# functionality of Tilda. We will most likely in the future add Jasmine to perform JS testing. \r\n\r\n\r\nFAQs\r\n=====\r\nQ: What will Tilda do for me?  \r\nA: Tilda aims to collect all the data from a slide, then, as accurately as possible, will convert that slide data to javascript code that interacts with RaphaelJS. RaphaelJS is a library that creates cross-browser vector graphics and animations using SVG and VML. \r\n\r\nQ: Can I work on Tilda?  \r\nA: Yes PLEASE!!! I need help :).\r\n\r\nQ: What do you need help with? How far along are you?  \r\nA: https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/536345/stories , We will be using pivotaltracker to keep schedule features. This should help us see what is complete, what needs to be done, and track our ideas as well!\r\n  \r\nQ: Why is it called Tilda?  \r\nA: It is just my favorite little delimeter. Also, originally, I had done some extremely stupid things with it in the code base. \r\n\r\n","tagline":"A powerpoint to SVG/VML/JS/CSS/HTML \"compiler\"","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
