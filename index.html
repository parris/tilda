<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>We know you've always dreamed about using powerpoint to create cross-platform content (I mean who hasn't...). Well here we go. We've started a project to do just that.
Tilda is basically a <b>powerpoint to SVG/VML and JS/CSS/HTML "compiler"/"converter"/"generator".</b> What does that mean? It basically means you can export your PowerPoint slide decks to the web AND include all those fancy animations you've programmed in as well.</p>

<h1>Why?/Goals</h1>
<p>After looking around the interwebs for a long time all I could really find were scripts that exported slides as images or 
as videos. The animations were all lost with image export plugins and interactions were gone with videos. In short, we made tilda as a
result of these deficiencies. Over time we plan on developing Tilda to the point where we incorporate all, if not most major features of powerpoint. 
We also plan to add a few other features which allow for things like "drag and drop", "collision detection" and "triggers" so that you can really get
a handful of simple, nice interactions. </p>
<p>The goal of Tilda is not only to help you export powerpoint presentations, but to allow you to modify how you want to export as well. 
Perhaps you like 97% of what we do, but we are just missing 1 little thing. Well Tilda is open source, you can modify it however you wish!
There were a few tools which had some potential; however, they all charged way too much and didn't work exactly how we needed. We know
others have the same issue so Tilda is our workaround. 
</p>
<p>Lastly, we saw potential for taking some of Flash's market for simple animations. Now, flash is great, but a) it is expensive and 
b) it is over kill for 99% of things you may want to do. Menus can be created with html/css and there are plenty of generators for that. 
Animations can be done with javascript, but programmers are needed for that. There is gap there that flash didn't even solve. There are 
plenty of little animated sequences that can be created with just powerpoint and are good enough for production. Now, I don't know if Tilda 
will ever handle complex animations or anything; however, it is at least a step in the right direction as far as authoring tools go. With a 
little time it might be able to replace Flash for those sorts of projects, and free up developers a bit to focus on actual application 
building as opposed to creating simple animations/content.
</p>

<h1>FAQs</h1>

<p>Q: What will Tilda do for me?<br>
A: Tilda aims to collect all the data from a slide, then, as accurately as possible, will convert that slide data to javascript code that interacts with RaphaelJS. RaphaelJS is a library that creates cross-browser vector graphics and animations using SVG and VML. </p>

<p>Q: Can I work on Tilda?<br>
A: Yes PLEASE!!! I need help :).</p>

<p>Q: What do you need help with? How far along are you?<br>
A: <a href="https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/536345/stories">https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/536345/stories</a> , We will be using pivotaltracker to keep a schedule of features. This should help us see what is complete, what needs to be done, and track our ideas as well!</p>

<p>Q: Why is it called Tilda?<br>
A: It is just my favorite little delimeter. Also, originally, I had done some extremely stupid things with it in the code base. </p>
